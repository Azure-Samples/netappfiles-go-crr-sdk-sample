# Azure NetApp Files CRR SDK Sample for Go

This sample demonstrates how to enable cross-region replication (CRR) on NFSv3 volume using Azure Go SDK for Microsoft.NetApp resource provider. This process is identical for NFS v4.1 volumes with exception of protocol type used.

In this sample application we perform the following operations:

* Creation
  * Primary NetApp account
    * Primary capacity pool
      * Primary NFS v3 volume
  * Secondary NetApp account
    * Secondary capacity pool
      * Secondary NFS v3 Data Replication volume with reference to the primary volume Resource ID
* Authorize primary volume with secondary volume Resource ID
* Clean up created resources (not enabled by default) 

If you don't already have a Microsoft Azure subscription, you can get a FREE trial account [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=330212).

## Prerequisites

1. Go installed \(if not installed yet, follow the [official instructions](https://golang.org/dl/)\)
2. Azure Subscription.
3. Subscription needs to have Azure NetApp Files resource provider registered. For more information, see [Register for NetApp Resource Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-register).
4. Resource Group(s) created
5. Virtual Networks (both for primary and secondary volumes) with a delegated subnet to Microsoft.Netapp/volumes resource. For more information, see [Guidelines for Azure NetApp Files network planning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-network-topologies).
6. Adjust variable contents within `var()` block at `example.go` file to match your environment
7. For this sample Go console application work, we need to authenticate through az cli.
   * From terminal, perform login to your Azure account:

     ```bash
     az login
     ```

   * Set the subscription to be used:

     ```bash
     az account set -s <subscription name or id>
     ```

   * Set the subscription ID environment variable:

     **PowerShell example:**

     ```powershell
     $env:AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your subscription id>"
     ```

     **Bash example:**

     ```bash
     export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your subscription id>"
     ```

    >Note: for other Azure Active Directory authentication methods for Go, please refer to [Authentication methods in the Azure SDK for Go](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/go/azure-sdk-go-authorization).

    * Copy the output content, paste it in a file called azureauth.json, and secure it with file system permissions (make sure it is not inside of any repo).
    * Set an environment variable pointing to the file path you just created. Here is an example with Powershell and bash:

      Powershell

      ```powershell
      [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION", "C:\sdksample\azureauth.json", "User")
      ```

      Bash

      ```bash
      export AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION=/sdksamples/azureauth.json
      ```

    >Note: For other Azure Active Directory authentication methods for Go, see [Authentication methods in the Azure SDK for Go](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/go/azure-sdk-go-authorization).

## What does example.go do

This sample project demonstrates how to enable cross-region replication in Azure NetApp Files for an NFSv3 enabled volume. (Note that this process is the same for NFSv4.1 volumes.) Similar to other examples, the authentication method is based on a service principal. This project will create two NetApp accounts in different regions, each with a capacity pool. A single volume using the Premium service level as the Primary volume, and the Standard service level in the secondary region with Data Protection object.

The process of enabling cross-region replication involves creating the primary resources, including primary volume.  Then we continue to create the secondary resources, but the secondary volume needs to contain the Data Replication Object. After this step, we authorize the replication from the primary volume, referencing the resource ID of the secondary volume.

In addition, in the initial stages, we get the subscription ID. This information is used for the test we perform to check if the subnet provided exists before creating any Azure NetApp Files resources, failing execution if they're missing.

Authentication is made on each operation where we obtain an authorizer to pass to each client we instantiate (in Azure Go SDK for Azure NetApp Files, each resource has its own client). For more information about the authentication process used, see the [Authentication methods in the Azure SDK for Go](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/go/azure-sdk-go-authorization) document.

The last step is the cleanup process (which is not enabled by default; you need to change variable `shouldCleanUp` to `true` at `example.go` file `var()` section to clean up). The process must delete all resources in the reverse order, following the hierarchy; otherwise, we can't remove resources that have nested resources. Before removing the secondary volume, we need to remove the data replication object on it. If there is an error during the application execution, the cleanup process does not take place, and you need to manually perform this task.
The cleanup process uses a function called `WaitForNoANFResource`, while other parts of the code uses `WaitForANFResource`.  Currently, this behavior is required in order to work around the ARM behavior that reports that the object was deleted when in fact its deletion is still in progress (similarly, stating that volume is fully created while the creation is still completing). Also, we will see functions called `GetAnf<resource type>`; these functions were created in this sample to get the name of the resource without its hierarchy represented in the `<resource type>.name` property, which cannot be used directly in other methods of Azure NetApp Files client like `get`.

>Note: see [Resource limits for Azure NetApp Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-resource-limits) to understand Azure NetApp Files limits.
